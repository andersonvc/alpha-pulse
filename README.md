# Alpha-Pulse: Intelligent SEC 8-K Parser for Financial Modeling

Alpha-Pulse is an LLM-powered agent system that automatically connects to the [SEC EDGAR](https://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml) database, extracts and parses 8-K filings, and returns structured, context-aware outputs designed for seamless integration into financial models and investment analysis workflows.

---

## Overview

Manually parsing SEC filings is time-consuming and error-prone. Alpha-Pulse automates this process using Large Language Models (LLMs) that understand the nuances of financial disclosures. Given any publicly traded company, the agent fetches the latest 8-K filing, interprets the content using domain-specific reasoning, and structures the output for downstream processing.

## Key Features

- **Automatic EDGAR Integration**: Fetches the latest 8-K filings using EDGAR's API or RSS feeds.  
- **LLM-Powered Understanding**: Uses custom LLM agents trained for financial disclosure analysis.  
- **Structured Output**: Parses item numbers, materiality, sentiment, and expectations into JSON for easy integration.  
- **Model-Ready Data**: Designed for use in financial models, dashboards, or automated alert systems.  
- **Multi-Company Context**: Identifies and includes related companies referenced in the filing.
